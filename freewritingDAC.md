#DAC - Distributed Autonomous Company

The concept of the distributed autonomous company or DAC is a model for thinking about distributed systems or applications. The need for this model is to emphasise a key difference between DACs, DAC coins also called shares, and Altcoins such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin in many ways resembles a company. It has workers. Those worker, known as miners, are paid in mining rewards to help maintain the Bitcoin network which has no centralised point of operations. The miners perform essential work for the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin can then be seen as a service business. Its business is money transmission and keeping a secure ledger of accounts. To continue the analogy, Bitcoin holders can be seen as shareholders in the company. However, this is where the key distinction between DACs and Altcoins arrises; shareholders are never paid dividends and are actually punished, in the form of a tariff, for using Bitcoin's services. Every transaction on the network requires a fee to be processed and this fee goes to the miners. In a DAC, the transaction fee is returned to shareholders in a form of dividend. The dividend gives a DAC's services value and rewards shareholders. Ultimately, the tariff system employed by Bitcoin and other alt coins may be their true Achille's heel. Bitcoin coins are simultaneously treated as currency and commodity, but they are only a commodity in the sense that they can be traded on their price fluctuations. And without people acting as shareholders, the bottom of the bitcoin market may only be as high as its true believers. A DAC's coin or share adds the aspect of having a true value storing commodity, much more comparable to precious metals or stocks in a company. 

What can a DAC do?
A DAC can do many things any application can. The structure differ greatly and a since they are decentralised, upgrading its systems is more difficult. The community of users must agree on upgrades and new features.

How are DACs distributed?
A key strength of a DAC comes from having no central point of failure. After their release, as long as shareholder and costumers of the DAC run and use its software, the DAC runs and remains alive.

How are DACs autonomous?
The services DAC performs are predictable and automated. If you send a share to a friend, the system takes care of the transaction without any outside help or processing.

How are DACs a company?
DACs have costumers and shareholders. DACs can even reward workers for performing services needed by it.
