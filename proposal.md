SportDAC is a decentralized solution to the betting exchange, also known as open-market betting. Betting exchanges work differently from traditional bookmarker services and don’t require funds to pay off winners. A betting exchange is a prediction market and works similarly to other markets. A punter can go long, bet an event will occur, or go short, bet an event won’t occur. Bets are matched with other bets. The betting is a zero sum game. Bets can be made on any verifiable future event.

Our decentralized solution gives any user the chance to become a market maker, called an Agent, who can earn commissions and reputation for promoting SportDAC’s services and opening up markets. 

The gambling industry world wide is predicted to grow to over 500 Billion by 2015. Many participants in this market are restricted to approved activities. Our decentralized solution has the potential to reach users in every market with internet access. 

SportDAC will pay commissions to Agents and will also pay dividends to shareholders. SportDAC will honor ProtoShares at a 1:1 ratio. We will use AngelShares to raise development funds but have yet to decide on a model. 

SportDAC is being developed by two Bitshares community members, que23 and devilfish. Our combined experiences and skills include web development, business management, community building and we have mature understanding of distributed systems and technologies. We would work on the front end of the project to build a community and attract investors.

We are currently not soliciting funding. We are looking for qualified developers interested in working or consulting on this project. We think this is an exciting project and look forward to hearing from you.
